## Session 6-1: Introduction to Redux

### Preparation 1: Video course with questions

Watch the Youtube playlist by Bucky Roberts called [React JS / Redux Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBbSLZjvleMwldX8jGgXV6a). There are eleven video's and together they're quite exactly an hour and a half long.

While watching the video's answer the questions in [this questionnaire](https://goo.gl/forms/StE7MdFmbY5ks79W2). The questionnaire has a page for every video with two or three questions. **This is an assignment** _You have to do this._  
But you don't have to fill out the form in a single session. That is why the form has none of the questions marked as required. But still, you do have to answer them all.

_Don't forget to copy the URL of the "Edit you reaction"-link that the form shows at the end, if you want to continue working on the form at a later time._

### Preparation 2: Read about Redux + Q&A

There is an introduction to Redux on the Redux site itself which is excellent. It does, however, help to have watched the [Redux video's](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBbSLZjvleMwldX8jGgXV6a) from the previous preparation before you start this tutorial.
Read and experiment with the first five parts of [Redux Fundamentals](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-1-overview):

- [Part 1: Redux Overview](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-1-overview)
- [Part 2: Concepts and Data Flow](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-2-concepts-data-flow)
- [Part 3: State, Actions, and Reducers](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-3-state-actions-reducers)
- [Part 4: Store](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-4-store) (you may skip the section about [Middleware](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-4-store#middleware); for now)
- [Part 5: UI and React](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-5-ui-react)

ðŸ‘‰ **Q&A** â€“ Please post 2 questions, or discussion items about Redux [here](https://dwa-courses.firebaseapp.com/qna_cwd_6.1.html).

### Preparation 3: Play with the Time Traveling Debugger

Do [the following exercise](session6.1/preparation/), to get familiar with one of the two most important reasons to like Redux.

:question: What's the other important reason people choose Redux?

### Classroom activities

- Q&A discussion
- Teacher-Demo: [Immutability in Javascript](session6.1/teacherDemo/2-immutability-in-js.md)
- Teacher-Demo: [Reduxifying the RrHN-client](session6.1/teacherDemo/1-rrhn-redux-tour.md)
- Workshop: [Implement the logic for the preferences dialog using Redux.](https://dwa-courses.firebaseapp.com/assignment_cwd_6.1.html). Instead of your own version of RrHN, you _use the starter-code in [session6.1/workshop/rrhn-redux/](session6.1/workshop/rrhn-redux/)_. **This is an assignment**, so you have to finish this.

## Session 6-2: Redux + AJAX

### Preparation 1: Get the Redux code for the Preferences Dialog in the RrHN-client working

In the [workshop directory for session 6-1](session6.1/workshop), you'll find the Reduxyfied RrHN client, but the code to make the Preferences Dialog work is missing.

ðŸ‘‰ Fix the code, and make the Preferences Dialog work.

Submit your work using the form in [this assignment page](https://dwa-courses.firebaseapp.com/assignment_cwd_6.1.html).

### Preparation 2: Read about Async Actions in Redux + Â½ Q&A

There is more to know about Redux Middleware and Side Effects. Read and study the following parts:

- the skipped section about [Middleware](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-4-store#middleware) from [Part 4: Store](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-4-store)
- [Part 6: Async Logic and Data Fetching](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-6-async-logic)

But there's (a little bit) more. From the "Introduction" and "Thinking in Redux" chapter of the docs, read the following three pages:

- [Motivation](https://redux.js.org/understanding/thinking-in-redux/motivation)
- [Three Principles](https://redux.js.org/understanding/thinking-in-redux/three-principles)
- [Core Concepts](https://redux.js.org/introduction/core-concepts)

ðŸ‘‰ Please post 2 questions, or discussion items about the text [here](https://dwa-courses.firebaseapp.com/qna_cwd_6.2.html).

### Classroom activities

- discussion of your work on the RrHN client.
- Q&A discussion
- Workshop: [Build AJAX into the Reduxyfied RrHN-client](https://dwa-courses.firebaseapp.com/assignment_cwd_6.2.html). **This is an assignment**, so you have to do this.

## Session 6-3: Small-test

### Preparation

Prepare for the small-test by studying:

- [Part 1: Redux Overview](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-1-overview)
- [Part 2: Concepts and Data Flow](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-2-concepts-data-flow)
- [Part 3: State, Actions, and Reducers](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-3-state-actions-reducers)
- [Part 4: Store](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-4-store)
- [Part 5: UI and React](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-5-ui-react)
- [Part 6: Async Logic and Data Fetching](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-6-async-logic)
- [Motivation](https://redux.js.org/understanding/thinking-in-redux/motivation)
- [Three Principles](https://redux.js.org/understanding/thinking-in-redux/three-principles)
- [Core Concepts](https://redux.js.org/introduction/core-concepts)

### Classroom activities

- **The small-test prep:** Your last opportunity to ask questions before the small-test.
- **The small-test**
- **Small-test review**: What were the correct answers to the test questions?
- Finish your **workshop assignments**, if you haven't done so already.
